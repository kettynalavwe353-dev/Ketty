1. - button element - i faced challenges with adding hover effect to the buttons, color and size. 
   - input element  - i faced challenges with the button element because the buttons have different attribute type values, so i didn't know the exactly value to use for this type of           input.
   - textarea element - i faces challenges with adjusting the size, i faced challenges with the placeholder text. 
   - img element - i faced challenges displaying the image on my website because it was in a diffrent folder with my html files.

2. - article, i used it describe my personal blog (describing the website).
   - section, used it to separate and organize different sections for easy readability.
   - header, which was used as an introduction to the entire website containing navigation bars with quick links.
   - footer, used the footer to create copyrights and reference and the bottom of my website.

3. - the Heading element was most used because it helped to give a heading for each section so that users see which heading certain content belongs to.

                                                                          QUESTION 3
                                                                          
1. - class, id and and hover attribute.

2. - i used the class attribute  to Groups elements that share the same style or behavior and Id attribute to Uniquely identifies one specific element on a page.

3. - a hover attribute applied to the <a> (anchor) tag because It gives users immediate visual feedback when they move their cursor over a link, showing clearly that the text is              clickable.

                                                                          QUESTION 4
